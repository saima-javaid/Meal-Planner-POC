# My Journey with Agentic AI: Building a Meal Planner POC During Accenture's Summer-of-Q Challenge

*My honest experience using Kiro and Amazon Q to rapidly prototype and maintain complex applications*

---

## The Context: Accenture Summer-of-Q Challenge

During Accenture's Summer-of-Q challenge, developers across the company were tasked with building POCs to demonstrate the real-world benefits of agentic AI in development. While others explored Amazon Q, I chose to use the following two platforms to develop my POC:

- **Kiro** for end-to-end business POC development
- **Amazon Q** for testing, maintenance, and documentation

My goal was simple: prove that agentic AI could revolutionize how we build and maintain applications, more precisely how agentic AI is useful for the end-to-end software development lifecycle. However, I still need to explore more stages of the development and release process.

## The Experiment: 5 Hours to Full POC

I challenged myself to build a complete meal planning application from scratch. The result? **A fully functional POC in just 5 hours** - something that would traditionally take days or weeks.

## My Experience & Analysis: 5 Hours That Changed My Perspective

When I built a complete meal planning application in 5 hours, I learned that **Kiro and Amazon Q serve completely different purposes** - and that's their strength.

### The Kiro Experience: Rapid Innovation Engine
In those 5 hours, I built 10 interconnected React components with complex business logic - something that would traditionally take weeks of planning and development. Kiro didn't just speed up coding; it **democratized the ability to rapidly test market ideas**.

```javascript
// What I built in 5 hours with Kiro
src/components/
├── IntegratedMealFlow.js    # Complete workflow orchestrator
├── MealPlanner.js          # Weekly planning with nutrition
├── QuickMealPlanner.js     # AI-powered meal generation
├── SmartPlanner.js         # Inventory-based planning
└── GroceryManager.js       # Shopping & delivery integration
```

**The Reality**: Perfect for POCs and rapid prototyping, but success depends heavily on pricing accessibility.

### The Amazon Q Discovery: Maintenance Revolution
After building with Kiro, I realized the code would be tough for humans to understand and maintain. That's where Amazon Q proved invaluable - I was able to not only add tests but also add documentation.

Amazon Q generated 18 comprehensive test cases, complete documentation, and architecture diagrams. Amazon Q is not for building from scratch, but for **automating the entire development lifecycle**.

In my day job, it excelled at analyzing complex production incidents with complicated logs, generating reports that would take hours manually.

**The Insight**: Amazon Q transforms maintenance from burden to automated process. While there are other agentic AI tools in the market, my experience with Amazon Q has been consistently positive.

### The Key Revelation
**AI-generated code needs AI-generated documentation** for human handovers. This became crucial when I realized the POC would eventually need human developers to understand and extend it.

## My Final Thoughts: The Agentic AI Revolution is Here

### What I Proved in My Summer-of-Q Challenge
**Traditional POC Development**: 2-3 weeks, multiple developers, extensive planning  
**My Agentic AI Approach**: 5 hours, one developer, working application

### The Two-Tool Strategy
- **Kiro**: Revolutionary for rapid prototyping and idea validation
- **Amazon Q**: Essential for maintenance, testing, and making AI code human-readable
- **Together**: They democratize development and reduce cognitive stress

### Try It Yourself: Get Started with Agentic AI

**For Rapid Prototyping**: Kiro offers a **two-week trial** - perfect for testing business ideas and POC development. Whether it becomes your go-to tool will depend on their pricing model.

**For Code Maintenance**: Amazon Q is one of many good agentic AI tools in the market. While others exist with similar capabilities, my experience with Amazon Q has been positive for automation and development lifecycle management.

### The Bottom Line
This isn't just faster development - it's a **fundamental shift in how we innovate**. The Summer-of-Q challenge taught me that agentic AI isn't coming - it's here.

Adopting agentic AI at the enterprise level won't just be a great shift in innovation - it will fundamentally change the **speed of success** in the future. Organizations that embrace these tools now will have a significant competitive advantage.

**My advice**: Start experimenting with agentic AI today. The developers who embrace these tools now will lead tomorrow's innovation wave.

## Fun Fact: This Blog Was Also an AI Experiment!

I created this blog post using Amazon Q itself - how meta is that? It was interesting but definitely needed significant intervention to build it how I wanted and give it a human touch. Originally, it was all robotic and didn't reflect my personal experience, even though I provided a one-page input as a starter.

But I'm happy with the final output, and it took me about **2 hours** to finish this blog post with all the iterations and personal touches.

*Proof that even writing about AI tools requires the human element!*
